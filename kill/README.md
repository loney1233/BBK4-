blooket is   ....../Blooket is web-based so it can be accessed from nearly any device, ideal for students in class or at home. Teachers can lead the quiz or it can be left for individuals to access as they need. A selection of game modes is available, with different looking games to play in between the quiz parts of the learning.

Everything is points-based with rewards and character progression, making it very like the high-end polished games students may already play on their smartphones. These games can be played solo or in teams, so the teacher can select a group and have them compete against others in the class.

How does Blooket work?
Blooket(opens in new tab) is super simple to sign-up to, allowing teachers to get a free account right away with just their email address. Games can be created immediately from pre-built questions or using totally custom builds. Either way, teachers can assign a code for the game to students so that they can join easily as they want.
